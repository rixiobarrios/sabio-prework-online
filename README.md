# Sabio Pre-Work and Exercises Files (SabioV4)

This course is a prerequisite to the PreWork course that you need to pass to be accepted into the immersive programs we offer. If you have already taken an intro to JavaScript course then can simply scan the lecture topics and pick out the topics that you need to refresh.

This course is mainly aimed at delivering lectures to prepare you for PreWork so picking and choosing topics is possible if you have enough experience in the topic already.
